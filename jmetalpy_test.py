RASTRIGIN

The Rastrigin function is a well-known optimization test problem often used to evaluate
the performance of optimization algorithms. It is a non-linear, multi-modal function
characterized by its many local minima. The global minimum is located at the origin
(0, 0, ..., 0), where the function value is also 0.

"""
MUTATION

Mutation is a genetic operator that introduces small random changes in the individual's genotype.
In the code, the Polynomial Mutation operator is used, which perturbs the variable values
according to a polynomial distribution. The mutation probability and distribution index
are its main parameters.


CROSSOVER

Crossover, also known as recombination, is a genetic operator that combines the genetic material
of two parent individuals to create offspring. In the code, the Simulated Binary Crossover (SBX)
operator is used, which simulates the behavior of one-point crossover in binary-coded
Genetic Algorithms but works with real-coded variables. The crossover probability
and distribution index are its main parameters.
